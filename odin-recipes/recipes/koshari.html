        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Koshari (also spelled, Kushari) is the national dish of my birthplace, Egypt. By far one of my favorite things to eat--EVER! No matter how far I've traveled, I will always crave a humble bowl of koshari as served in the streets of Egypt.</p>
        <p>It may not look like much, but this Egyptian comfort food has every bit a satisfying depth and texture to it. It'll have you coming back for more!</p>
